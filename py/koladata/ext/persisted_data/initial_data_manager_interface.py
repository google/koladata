  """Manages the initial data of a PersistedIncrementalDataSliceManager.

  The initial data must be immutable. Updates to it are accepted only by
  PersistedIncrementalDataSliceManager, and never in this class/subclasses.

  Management of the initial data typically involves loading parts of it on
  demand from the underlying storage. The loaded data is typically cached to
  speed up subsequent calls to get_data_slice(). For data that can consume
  significant memory, implementations should take care to cache at most one
  copy of the data (across locally cached DataBags and deeper caches in the data
  sourcing infrastructure), because otherwise out-of-memory errors might happen.
  Clients can also call clear_cache() to remove the cached data; the expectation
  is that after calling clear_cache(), the memory footprint of an instance
  should be very small.

        manager returns more data than requested, and the extra data has been
        updated in the meantime, then the extra data will be outdated because

    any caches by this method. When the data is requested again in the future,
    then it will be loaded from the underlying storage and might be cached
    again.

    Calling this method will not affect the functional behavior of this manager.
    For example, the result of get_schema() will remain unchanged, and calling
    get_data_slice(...) will simply load the data again and return the same
