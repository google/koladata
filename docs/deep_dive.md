# Technical Deep Dive

This guide offers a technical deep dive into core Koda concepts for those
wanting to gain a deeper understanding of what powers it. This guide does *not*
provide detailed introductions to each topic and it is expected that the reader
is already familiar with Koda before proceeding. Please read
[Koda Overview](overview.md) and [Koda Fundamentals](fundamentals.md) to gain
familiarity with Koda.
